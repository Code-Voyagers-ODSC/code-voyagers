Tiktok Baked Feta Pasta
Baked feta pasta has it all, big bold flavors, creamy comfort, and carbs!

Baked feta pasta is the perfect summer food: it‚Äôs creamy, bright and tomato-y, and SO damn delicious. It‚Äôs probably the simplest pasta dish you‚Äôll make this month and the reward is so high for an incredibly low effort.

What is tiktok pasta?

It‚Äôs super simple: cherry tomatoes are tossed with olive oil and placed in a baking dish with a block of feta. Everything gets baked up until the tomatoes burst, releasing their sweet and jammy flavors. The feta gets melty and oozy. You mix it all up into a quick sauce, toss in minced garlic, basil, crushed red pepper, and pasta. Boom, dinner is done!

Tiktok pasta is so good and easy

Sometimes the best kind of cooking is the kind that takes no time at all so you can spend more time with loved ones enjoying the food. I love that the prep time for this dish is so low and the actual hands on time is super low. If you can stir, you can make this dish.

The dominant flavors of this pasta are feta and tomatoes, it‚Äôs practically a two ingredient pasta. If you‚Äôre not a huge feta fan, you can definitely use another cheese ‚Äì baked brie, cream cheese, or ricotta would be amazing.

    Bake: Bake the tomatoes and feta in the oven until the tomatoes burst and the cheese is melty.
    Cook: While the feta is in the oven, cook the pasta.
    Stir: When the tomatoes and feta are done, stir in some minced garlic, some crushed red pepper flakes, and the pasta, loosening with some pasta water if needed. Finish with fresh basil.
    Eat: That‚Äôs it! Scoop it up an enjoy a bowl of pure cheesy carby comfort.

    cherry tomatoes ‚Äì the sweeter the better! There are so many types of mini tomatoes these days, from strawberry to grape to on the vine to heirloom. I used one package of classic cherry tomatoes and one package of cherry tomatoes on the vine.
    feta ‚Äì you‚Äôll want to get a nice higher quality Greek feta since it‚Äôs the main flavor of the dish. Grab a block of feta, the kind that comes in a brine, not the crumbles. If you want a milder, creamier feta, try French feta, it‚Äôs less tart than Greek.
    olive oil ‚Äì most of the recipes I‚Äôve seen call from anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil. I went with 1/3 cup, you want enough to coat the tomatoes and feta while having a bit of oil pool at the bottom of your baking dish so the tomatoes are essentially doing a tomato confit type thing. Too little olive oil and your tomatoes will end up drying out.
    pasta ‚Äì you can use any shape you like, we went with casarecce the first time and rotini the second time and both were great.
    garlic ‚Äì a couple cloves of minced garlic are mixed in and the residual heat of the tomatoes mellows the sharpness out while still giving you a huge hit of garlicky goodness.
    basil ‚Äì fresh basil and tomatoes are perfect pairing. Slice some up to stir in and keep some extra leaves whole to garnish with!
