 
#From Perplexity.ai:  Here is an example of a Python smoke test script that you can save as TEST.sh. This script will check whether your agentic AI agent is "listening" to user input voice, assuming that there's a function or process your agent exposes for accepting or recognizing voice input.
#Instructions:
#Place the code below in a file named TEST.sh.
#Make it executable with chmod +x TEST.sh.
#Run it directly with ./TEST.sh.

python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
import time

def is_agent_listening():
    """
    Placeholder: Replace this function with the actual mechanism to check
    if your AI agent is actively listening for voice input.
    """
    # Example: maybe check process, socket, or call a REST API
    # Here we simply simulate a successful check
    # Replace the next line with your real check
    return True  # or False if not listening

def main():
    print("Running smoke test: Is agentic AI agent listening to User voice input?")
    # Give the agent a moment to initialize if needed
    time.sleep(1)
    listening = is_agent_listening()
    if listening:
        print("Smoke test passed: Agent is listening to user input voice.")
        sys.exit(0)
    else:
        print("Smoke test failed: Agent is NOT listening to user input voice.")
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
"""
Customizing This Script:
Replace the is_agent_listening() function with the actual check relevant to your agent. For example:
If there's a health check API endpoint, call it and inspect the result.
If the agent runs as a subprocess/service, check its log for "ready" state.
If you can send an audio sample and expect a reply, automate that in Python.
Notes:
Even saved as TEST.sh, the script runs as Python due to the shebang line.
This is a smoke test: it only verifies the basic functionâ€”that the agent is listening, not deep recognition accuracy.
For any automated CI or deployment, adjust the check to fit your actual agent architecture and communication interface.
If you provide the interface details for your agent (e.g., is it a REST API, a local process, etc.), I can tailor this script further to fit your exact setup.
